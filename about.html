        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I‚Äôm Mano Harsha Sappa! My journey into data science wasn‚Äôt something I had planned from the beginning, but rather something I discovered along the way. While pursuing my studies, I had the opportunity to work on an internship at Corizo Edutech, where I was introduced to Python, SQL, and data visualization. As I worked with real-world datasets, analyzing patterns and extracting insights, I realized how powerful data could be in solving problems and driving better decisions. That experience sparked my curiosity, and I found myself diving deeper into the world of data science, analytics, and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wanting to explore this field further, I pursued a Master‚Äôs in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University, focusing on machine learning, NLP, and cloud computing. Through various projects, I gained hands-on experience tackling real-world industry challenges, strengthening my technical skills while understanding how data science applies to practical problems across different domains.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my key projects, DARIA-3o: Chatbot for InfoTunnel, leveraged NLP to develop an intelligent chatbot capable of efficient information retrieval and processing, enhancing human-computer interactions and optimizing data accessibility. This project deepened my understanding of conversational AI and its role in improving user experience. Another project, Bridges at Risk: Coastal vs. Inland Environmental Impacts on Lifespan and Maintenance, analyzed how environmental factors affect bridge longevity using statistical modeling and predictive analytics to support infrastructure planning and decision-making. This research provided valuable insights into how data science can address real-world engineering challenges. Both projects were conducted under Dr. Duoduo (Lindi) Liao, whose expertise in AI, NLP, and data science inspired me to explore even more complex challenges in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these experiences, I‚Äôve built expertise in Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Power BI, along with AWS, Google Cloud, and Snowflake. I specialize in data cleaning, EDA, statistical modeling, and predictive analytics, turning raw data into insights. Working with real-world datasets reinforced the impact of data-driven decision-making. I aim to bridge business and data science, driving smarter decisions through big data, AI automation, and business intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm always excited to connect with professionals who share a passion for data science and innovation. If you're working on something exciting or seeking collaborationüí¨, let‚Äôs connect!üëç
